### Feedback

The directory and file structure looks good except for the name of the deployment directory (documentation). The deployment directory should be what you want to name the project, what you expect the website to be called, the future domain or an estimation of what the final name will be. For example, since this site's purpose is to promote your web development services, you might name the site EstebanMartinez.com, in which case you may name the directory /estebanmartinez/ or /esteban-martinez/ to match your github project name.

Your HTML code is perfect.

Your persona does a great job of defining a specific instance in your audience. However the audience is too vague. 

Imagine that you only have enough money to advertise your web development services to ten prospects. How would you narrow down your market to get the type of clients that you want to work with, that will pay well, that have a business that excites you, that want a website you will be proud to show..., or whatever criteria is important to you.

By getting as specific as you can when defining your audience, you will be able to target your marketing to get clients that you want to work with.

Overall you did a great job. Keep up the good work!
