This repository will include all milestones and information for my PWP

## Milestone 1

### Feedback

The directory and file structure looks good except for the name of the deployment directory (documentation). The deployment directory should be what you want to name the project, what you expect the website to be called, the future domain or an estimation of what the final name will be. For example, since this site's purpose is to promote your web development services, you might name the site EstebanMartinez.com, in which case you may name the directory /estebanmartinez/ or /esteban-martinez/ to match your github project name.

Your HTML code is perfect.

Your persona does a great job of defining a specific instance in your audience. However the audience is too vague. 

Imagine that you only have enough money to advertise your web development services to ten prospects. How would you narrow down your market to get the type of clients that you want to work with, that will pay well, that have a business that excites you, that want a website you will be proud to show..., or whatever criteria is important to you.

By getting as specific as you can when defining your audience, you will be able to target your marketing to get clients that you want to work with.

Overall you did a great job. Keep up the good work!

## Milestone 2A

### Feedback

HTML, CSS and directory structure is perfect. I am always happy to see when W3C Validator is free of errors [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~emartinez394%2Festeban-martinez%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-2.php). You seem to have a strong vision of what you want to accomplish with your PWP. Having such a concrete plan will make the development process a lot easier. The about me, portfolio, and contact me sections should be straight foreword and easy to accomplish. For your portfolio I recommend using Bootstrap4 cards for your portfolio. For the icons I recommend using Font-Awesome5. Font-Awesome5 is used extensively in the class and has good documentation. I do have concerns about the Feed section. The layout for the feed section will be very hard to create with Bootstrap and will not be mobile friendly. The feed mobile view will be very cramped and hard to read with each small thumbnail in a row. It would make more sense if you had more of a list view for mobile. **I strongly urge you to drop the feed section unless you have the content ready to go**. Creation of the content would be out of scope for the project and would take away time better spent coding. That being said creation of the content and addition of a feed section would be a great thing to add after the bootcamp. I want to clarify that unless you have Rochelle's explicit permission PWP is a single page site. With the content you laid out, you will not need more than one page.

## Grade Tier III

## Milestone 2b Feedback

The cards are not in a container. Elements outside a bootstrap container can cause horizontal scroll.
Where will the links in the navbar go to?
What websites will be shown in the cards?
Will there be a footer?
Will you include links to your github and linkedin profiles?

Your Milestone 2b grade is Tier III
